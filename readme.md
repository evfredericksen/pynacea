#Pynacea

Pynacea is a voice recognition framework and grammar specification that allows
users to control their desktop environment through voice input. Possible
uses include editing text, shell commands, online browsing, and more.

This project is similar to the Natlink/Dragonfly/Aenea stack. However, Pynacea
does not hook into Dragon NaturallySpeaking. In exchange for losing the
ability to send commands to NaturallySpeaking, this project hopefully gains
stability and flexibility in that it does not require access to APIs from any
proprietary voice recognition software, and can in fact run alongside any voice
recognition program.
